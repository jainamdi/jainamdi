### Hi, I am JD  ðŸ‘‹




I'm a software developer engineer and computer science graduate student who is passionate about bringing ideas to live and build things that live on internet. Some technologies I enjoy working with include React JS, Node JS, MongoDB, Flask, Springboot, Android and RESTful APIs. I dream to be one of the developers who can successfully build the vehicle that can take people to moon ðŸš€.
